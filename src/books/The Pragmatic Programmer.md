# The Pragmatic Programmer

Author: Dave Thomas, Andy Hunt

## From the Preface to the First Edition

- pragmatic | skilled in business (latin) | fit for use (greek)
- pragmatic programmer's characteristics
    1. early adapter | love to try out new thing (experience)
    1. inquisitive | asking questions (pack rat for little facts)
    1. critical thinker | not taking things as given
    1. realistic | understand how hard the problem really is
    1. jack of all trades | always ready to do new things
- tip 1: only craft when you care
- tip 2: keep a situational awareness

## 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy

- tip 3: you have the agency
- tip 4: have responsibility
- tip 5: no broken windows (entropy)
- tip 6: induce change by doing
- tip 7: be aware of slow changes
- tip 8: make user understand the trade-offs
- tip 9: always invest in learning
- tip 10: think critically as a reader
- tip 11: package and communicate well
- tip 12: pitch well and gather feedback
- tip 13: document your code

## 2. A Pragmatic Approach

- tip 14: think about easy to change (ETC)
- tip 15: single representation no duplication (DRY)
- tip 16: make it easy to reuse

### Topic 11. Orthogonality

- vector | two lines are independent
- change in one should not affect the other

### Topic 12. Tracer Bullets

- how to hit targets in software development
- it depends on your aiming device
- tracer bullets create bright streaks in the air
- it provides real-time feedback
- same applies to novel projects
- when facing vague user requirements and changing environments
- you tend to over-specify and hope for the best
- pragmatics prefer software tracer bullets
- tracer bullets provide immediate feedback
- it quickly connect requirements to the final system
- high risk and requirement comes first
- start with "hello world"
- find simple feature that exercise all layers
- we had a complex system with many uncertainties
- we built a limited system with all layers included
- tracer code is not disposable
- it is an incremental approach
- the conventional is heavy modular approach
- tracer method has many advantages
- 1 users will be exited by the progress
- 2 have a structure to built on
- 3 integrate incrementally instead of attempting a big-bang
- 4 have something to demonstrate
- 5 make small but sequential progress
- tracer bullets aid in aim adjustment
- tracer code solidifies the project with minimal code
- based on reality, not paper specification
- tracer code is not prototyping, it won't be discarded
- shippers packing application needs intuitive interface and complex algorithms
- prototyping enables concept testing and subsequent detailed development
- tracer code shows how to connect different components of an application.
- prototyping generate disposable code (reconnaissance)
- trace code becomes the skeleton (fire)
