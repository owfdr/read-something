## Preface: Invalidating Axioms

<!-- stash
1. math is based on axioms | software world is ever-changing
2. state of dynamic equilibrium | chaotic change in the long-term | Kubernetes
3. question fundamental axioms regularly | think of dynamic equilibrium
4. all innovations lead to new capabilities and tradeoffs | XP -> CD -> DevOps -> Microservices -> Containerization -> Serverless
-->

1. software world is ever changing
2. short equilibrium, long-term chaotic change
3. question old axioms
4. new capabilities and tradeoffs | XP -> CD -> DevOps -> Microservices -> Container -> Cloud
5. changes and today's perspective
6. emphasis on discipline
7. every choice is a tradeoff
8. modern overview of software architecture

## Chapter 1 - Introduction

1. why no clearly defined career path?
2. no clear definition
3. scope of the field (Figure 1-1)
4. expanding role
5. dynamic problem (non-static)
6. outdated solutions
7. in need of reassessment
8. must study in context

### Defining Software Architecture

1. roadmap or blueprint? | what does it actually contains?
2. structure refers to architecture style (microkernel, microservices) | incomplete
3. characteristics refers to architecture quality | distinct from functionality
4. decisions represents rules of constructions | what is allowed and what is not
5. rules can be broken through variance | ARB
6. principles are guidelines rather than hard rules

> architecture | structure + characteristics, decisions + principles (Figure 1-2)

### Expectations of an Architect

1. emphasis on expectations rather than role
2. eight core expectations
    - make decisions
    - continually analyze
    - keep with trends
    - ensure compliance
    - diverse experience
    - business domain knowledge
    - interpersonal skills
    - navigate politics
3. succuss requires meeting these expectations

#### Make Architecture Decisions

1. purpose: guide your team
2. guide rather than specify (reactive-based framework vs. React.js)
3. help teams make the right choices | there is a line

#### Continually Analyze the Architecture

1. purpose: make improvements
2. avoid structural decay
3. don't overlook testing and release environments | agility
4. requires holistic analysis
