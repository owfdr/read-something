## Preface: Invalidating Axioms

**Do:** Look at old axioms under new light 

<!-- stash
1. math is based on axioms | software world is ever-changing
2. state of dynamic equilibrium | chaotic change in the long-term | Kubernetes
3. question fundamental axioms regularly | think of dynamic equilibrium
4. all innovations lead to new capabilities and tradeoffs | XP -> CD -> DevOps -> Microservices -> Containerization -> Serverless

0. axiom: proposition regarded as being true
1. software world changes at a rapid pace
2. short equilibrium, long-term chaotic change
3. question old axioms
4. new capabilities and tradeoffs | XP -> CD -> DevOps -> Microservices -> Container -> Cloud
5. changes and today's perspective
6. emphasis on discipline
7. everything is a tradeoff
8. modern overview of software architecture

## Chapter 1 - Introduction

**Do:** Put each architecture under its context

<!-- 
1. why no clearly defined career path?
2. no clear definition
3. scope of the field (Figure 1-1)
4. expanding role
5. dynamic problem (non-static)
6. outdated solutions
7. in need of reassessment
8. must study in context 
-->

### Defining Software Architecture

**Mz:** style + quality + rule + guideline = architecture

<!-- 
1. roadmap or blueprint? | what does it actually contains?
2. structure refers to architecture style (microkernel, microservices) | incomplete
3. characteristics refers to architecture quality | distinct from functionality
4. decisions represents rules of constructions | what is allowed and what is not
5. rules can be broken through variance | ARB
6. principles are guidelines rather than hard rules 
-->

### Expectations of an Architect

**Mz:** Eight expectations

<!-- 
1. emphasis on expectations rather than role
2. eight core expectations
    - make decisions
    - continually analyze
    - keep with trends
    - ensure compliance
    - diverse experience
    - business domain knowledge
    - interpersonal skills
    - navigate politics
3. succuss requires meeting these expectations 
-->

#### Make Architecture Decisions

**Do:** Guide rather than specify

<!-- 
1. purpose: guide your team
2. guide rather than specify (reactive-based framework vs. React.js)
3. help teams make the right choices | there is a line 
-->

#### Continually Analyze the Architecture

**Do:** Improve to avoid decay

<!-- 
1. purpose: make improvements
2. avoid structural decay
3. don't overlook testing and release environments | agility
4. requires holistic analysis 
-->

#### Keep Current with Latest Trends

**Do:** Update your knowledge

#### Ensure Compliance with Decisions

**Do:** Oversee the implementation

#### Diverse Exposure and Experience

**Do:** Expand your technical breadth

#### Have Business Domain Knowledge

**Do:** Learn your business

#### Possess Interpersonal Skills

**Do:** Take leadership

#### Understand and Navigate Politics

**Mz:** Every decision you make will be challenged
