 ## Building Blocks of a Web Application

- User Interface
- Routing
- Data Fetching
- Rendering
- Integrations
- Infrastructure
- Performance
- Scalability
- Developer Experience

## What is React?

- React is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

## What is Next.js?

- Next.js is a React framework for building web applications
- framework gives structure

## Imperative vs Declarative Programming

- imperative programming: give step by step instruction to do something | how to make a üçï
- declarative programming: simply describe what should happen | order a üçï
- one popular declarative library for building ui is React

## React vs React DOM

- react: library for building ui
- react-dom: library for rendering in the browser
- allows to render on different platforms (react-native)

## JSX

- syntax extension for JavaScript (not supported natively)
- require a transpiler (babel) to convert it to something browser understands (standard JavaScript)

## React Components

- react components are just functions that return JSX
- function name must be capitalized (to distinguish from html tags)
- by nesting components, it creates component tree
- react's modular format makes component reuse possible

## Development vs Production Environment

- environment: where your code is running
- development: running on the local machine
- production: running on the remote machine
- move to production: compile, bundle, minify, code split

## The Next.js Compiler

- Next.js provides it's own compiler

## Pre-Rendering

- server-side rendering: render on the server and send the html to the browser
- static site generation: generate html at build time and reuse it on each request

## `Link` Component

- enables client-side navigation 
- transitions handled by JavaScript (no page refresh)
- prefetches the linked page when appeared in the viewport

## `Image` Component

- uses modern format WebP (if supported by the browser)
- lazy loaded (if outside of viewport)
- avoids Cumulative Layout Shift


## Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

- sudden layout shift due to some action
- one of the core web vitals in SEO
